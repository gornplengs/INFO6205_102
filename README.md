The topic of our project: Game of Life (cellular automata problem)

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970." Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules.

Team number: team 102
What we Did:

•	Create many patterns derive from a random number sequence
•	Create a genetic algorithm to find the best pattern which can have max Generations
•	Create a fitness function which is a measure of how good a candidate solution is for finding the best pattern which can have max Generations
•	Create a candidate selection function to select individuals who can produce next generations. There is a condition that only if the individual’s fitness is not less than the average fitness, they will generate next generations.
•	Create a mutation function to in which a new pattern of chromosome expression
•	Create an expression function to show the different between genotype and phenotype
•	Create unit tests to test most of the methods to keep the project operating properly
•	Add UI which users can upload a file and run the generation algorithm
